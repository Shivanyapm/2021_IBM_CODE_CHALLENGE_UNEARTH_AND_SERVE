# Outline of the project

Develop a Web-app for Health and Education Support system in rural areas in Kerala.

Identify the Rural areas and list them in the Application.

Collect the details of residents in the particular area from a Person of Contact (PoC) in that area. The number of families, each family member Aadhar details(UID, Age), Ration card for income details, Details of students from the local school for supporting their higher education, details of patients from the nearest hospital(prepare a separate dataset for both education and health).

Perform supervised learning on the dataset to train the model according to existing dataset.

Import the JSON file to the web-app for automation.

List the needy persons' details in an encrypted format (hashing) under both categories.

Administrators' calculate the expected fund for each category according to Expert opinion.

Invite sponsors to support - the first level will be through social media. We are focusing more on CSR funds in industries.

The needy persons will be intimated through the Person of Contact.

Future scope: Implement crowd funding to help needy persons as early as possible especially those who are suffering due to health issues. Transparency of crowd funding can be made sure by using a generic block chain framework.
